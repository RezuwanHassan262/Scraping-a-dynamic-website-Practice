# Scraping-a-dynamic-website-Practice
Here, I scraped and extracted data from a dynamic website as a practice work using **selenium** and **geckodriver** and later did data analysis using the **pandas** library.

The source of the data was this [website](https://research.com/scientists-rankings/computer-science).

This project aimed to scrape and extract data for data analysis on Computer Science scientists' ranking data and their other relevant information. This analysis was done to get insights into the data like Which school/university/organization has the best scientists, from which country most of them are from, and more.
